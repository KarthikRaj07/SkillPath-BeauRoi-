Edit `app/config.py`:

```python
OLLAMA_MODEL = "your-preferred-model:latest"
```

### Modifying System Prompt

Edit the system prompt in `app/services.py` to change the chatbot's personality and expertise areas.

### Adding Quick Replies

Edit `QUICK_REPLIES` array in `OllamaDeepseekChat.jsx`:

```javascript
const QUICK_REPLIES = [
  "Your new quick reply",
  "Another suggestion",
  // ... existing replies
];
```
